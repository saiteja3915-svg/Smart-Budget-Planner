# docs/ — Project Documentation Index

This directory contains the physical documentation for the project. Every architectural decision, user flow, and work item is tracked here.

## The Golden Rule
**One thing = One file.** Every API endpoint, user flow, or work item has exactly one doc file. This ensures clear context for both developers and AI agents.

## Project Overview
[Summarize the project's purpose, core mission, and primary users here. This serves as the high-level functional context for the entire codebase.]
